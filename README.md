the project instructions were as follows
You are however free to choose the protocol you will use (you are not obligated to
respect the RFC defining FTP, you can invent your own protocol of file transfers.) No
matter your choice, you must however absolutely obtain a coherence between your client
and your server. They must communicate properly with each other.
The communication between the server and the client will be in TCP/IP (v4).
